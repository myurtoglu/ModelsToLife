## ModelsToLife

### About

This software project is written by Di Zhang and Mete Yurtoglu in C++ using the [Qt framework](http://www.qt.io). It also uses [Open Asset Import Library](http://assimp.sourceforge.net) to import models into it. It can also accept .node and .ele files output from [TetGen](http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/) for tetrahedralization purposes.

### Description

ModelsToLife brings models to life by putting a mass-spring-damper particle system around the objects to be manipulated. It has gravity and collision for dropping objects. Individual nodes can also be picked and manipulated. There is also support for skeleton building and for skeletal manipulation. All these effects can be simulated under different conditions using sliders to set the gravity, the stiffness of the springs, etc.
